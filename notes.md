# TODO

## updates

* ripser to 1.0
* intrinsic persistence to 1.0
* geodesic complexes

## Intrinsic persistence

### islocallyminimal

* check if a cycle in complex is locally minimal
* when a locally minimal cycle gets reduced, a 2d feature is born
* provide proofs

### higher dimensional persistence

* ???

## Geodesic complexes

* Additional data set reduction -- connect all neighbors of removed points. The resolution
  changes -- loops with two edges. (resolution = 6r?)
* subsetting -- split into connected components.
* Complex beyond 2d?

## Manifolds.jl

rework and fix

## Datasets

* Find large 3d models
* Wood images
