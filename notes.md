# TODO

## updates

* ripser to 1.0
* intrinsic persistence to 1.0
* geodesic complexes

## Intrinsic persistence

### islocallyminimal

* check if a cycle in complex is locally minimal
* when a locally minimal cycle gets reduced, a 2d feature is born
* provide proof

### higher dimension

* ???

## Geodesic complexes

* Additional data set reduction -- connect all neighbors of removed points. The resolution
  changes -- loops with two edges. (6r?)
* Complex beyond 2d?

## Datasets

* Find large 3d models
* Wood images
